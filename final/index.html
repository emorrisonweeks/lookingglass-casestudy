            <h1>Season 2022-23 Now On Sale</h1>
            <p><strong>See Yourself here, Chicago. In the Lookingglass.</strong></p>
            <p>A partnership with one of this city’s leading Black theatre companies. A homegrown holiday hearth-warmer. Two original CHI-made works each featuring unconventional central characters. A twirl around five extraordinary homespun districts (from Englewood to Edgewater to Avalon Park and more). And a transcendent summer sunset ritual that draws us all back waterside.</p>
            <p>Distinct. Unique. Reflecting is our function.</p>

            <h3>What to Send Up When It Goes Down</h3>
            <p><strong>Produced by Congo Square Theatre In Residence at Lookingglass Theatre</strong></p>
            <p>Written by <strong>Aleshea Harris</strong></p>
            <p>Directed by <strong>Artistic Associate Ericka Ratcliff and Daniel Bryant</strong></p>
            <p>In residence at Lookingglass Theatre Company, produced by Congo Square, returning this Fall is Aleshea Harris’ What to Send Up When It Goes Down. Described as a play-pageant-ritual-homegoing celebration, What to Send Up When It Goes Down responds to the gratuitous loss of Black lives and interrupts discourses that enable the ubiquity of racialized violence in our society.</p>
            <p>This vibrant, necessary, soul-stirring event played to sold-out houses in the Spring and we are proud to host its return. In line with Congo Square and our commitment to community engagement, we are proud to announce that half of the tickets for each performance will be donated to local community groups.</p>
            <p><strong>Running September 24 – October 16, 2022

            <h3>50 Wards: A Civic Mosaic</h3>
            <p><strong>Featuring Five Short Films</strong></p>
            <p>Chicago from above. Contiguous. Glittering. Bordered only by vast, shimmering Lake Michigan. A city connected.</p>
            <p>Chicago at street level. Blocks sliced into 50 disparate districts. A city splintered.</p>
            <p><strong><em>50 Wards: A Civic Mosaic</em></strong>is an ambitious multi and mixed media attempt to weave together through storytelling savvy a dazzling tapestry of hometown experiences, bridge the distance between neighborhoods, and plot the line from our fascinating history to our complex present on through to tomorrow’s promise.</p>
            <p>When last we met in the wards, we saw you in the woods (39th), at the jazz joint (49th), behind the fortress walls (25th), parading (3rd), and tapping through Time (30th). The next 5 in this series of 50 will see you before a mural (16th), at the shipping store (40th), in silent films (47th), and in two theatres – one abandoned (8th) and one a toy (5th).</p>
            <p>See your city through the glimmer of the artist’s eye and discover how and where we fit…together.</p>

            <h3>The Steadfast Tin Soldier</h3>
            <p><strong>Chicago's Beloved Holiday Tradition</strong></p>
            <p><strong>From the Story by Hans Christian Anderson</strong></p>
            <p>Written and Directed by <strong>Ensemble Member Mary Zimmerman</strong></p>
            <p>Chicago’s beloved holiday tradition returns to the stage this holiday season, a classic the whole family will treasure! Based on Hans Christian Andersen’s story about a little tin soldier who never gives up, Ensemble Member Mary Zimmerman’s production is a gorgeous spectacle of music and movement that the Chicago Tribune calls:</p>
            <p>“★★★★ A treat for all ages! It’s transformational, truly. Barely
                more than an hour-long, this is one holiday experience you don’t want to
                miss.”</p>

        <p><strong>A World Premiere Musical</strong></p>
        <p>Composed and Written by <strong>Artistic Associate Matthew C. Yee</strong>
            Directed by Amanda Dehnert</p>
        <p>Hooray! Lucy and Charlie just got hitched…and they’re embracing the worst of the American dream. They do what they want. Take what they want. They’re First Generation Asian American Renegades. In love. And on the run.</p>
        <p>Featuring original country western and folk songs, directed by Amanda Dehnert (Peter Pan (A Play), Eastland), Lucy and Charlie’s Honeymoon tracks a young couple as they rev it down quintessentially American highways and across stereotypic borders, fleeing expectation and trawling up trouble along the way.</p>
        <p>Fresh from his Broadway debut in Almost Famous The Musical, Artistic Associate Matthew C. Yee’s world premiere musical romp gives a nod to America’s past, takes tally of its present, and blows its future wide open.</p>
